Please make sure your PR follows those guidelines:

- [ ] Unit tests for everything.
- [ ] Documentation has been written on the [documentation website](https://github.com/officelifehq/docs).

** `.env` file

- [ ] If you change or add a variable in the `.env` file, don't forget to update the `.env.example` file.
- [ ] Once the change is in production, add it to the .env prod file on Fortrabbit (this is for the maintainers of the project).

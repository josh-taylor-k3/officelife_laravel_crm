# Introduction

## Homas in 1 minute

Homas is a new kind of human resource software. Its main goals are to:
- help managers be more empathetic,
- help companies be better at managing people's dreams and ambitions,
- help employees communicate with their employers,
- give users and companies a complete control over their data,
- reduce the use of LinkedIn and all the bullshit associated with it in today's world.

Unlike any other popular tools in this field, Homas is open source and can be installed on a server that you own if you so desire.

In terms of user experience, the software aims to be simple to use with the minimum amount of configuration. Design is not a priority - user experience is.

To use the software, users have to pay a fair fixed monthly fee, regardless of the size of your team. We do not sell your data, don't use ads nor use external analytical services. You can export your data at anytime or use the API without restrictions.

Technically, the software is developed with boring, proven, predictible, easy to maintain technologies that make the tool fast and secure. We want to create a product useful for our users, not something that is technologically exciting.

## Homas in 10 minutes

Homas is built around the notion that while companies own data about their employees, users have complete control over which data they give to companies.

Why open source?



## Users vs employees

Homas makes the distinction between users and employees.

A user is someone who creates an account on the Homas platform. An employee is an entity who is part of a company on Homas. A user can be an employee in one or more companies, but an employee can only be linked to a single user.

What we just explained is an important concept in Homas. In an ideal world, every company would run on Homas to manage their human resources, and once a user has a profile on Homas, he can simply join other companies as he changes jobs, and most data about him would follow (if he wants to). At any time, the user has the control over his data.
